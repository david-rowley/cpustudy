2 Out-of-order execution:

"if the later instructions need the outputs from the earlier
instruction. If each instruction depends on the result of the preceding instruction, then we
have no opportunities for out-of-order execution. This is called a dependency chain."


Instruction retirement:


"After all the operations are finished, the value in the temporary register that represents the
last value of EAX in the code sequence is written to a permanent EAX register. This process
is called retirement (see e.g. page 83)."

"Speculative execution means that the
instructions are decoded and executed, but the results are not retired into the permanent
register file, and memory writes are pending until the branch instruction is finally resolved."
